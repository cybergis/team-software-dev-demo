Tutorial
========

This tutorial walks through the basics of team software development with a very basic example in Python. The tutorial will use a toy Python package ``mycybergis``. We will briefly talk about code quality/linting and automated testing, but mostly we will focus on using Github for collaborative and organized development.

.. note::
   
    **Before you start,** please setup a Github account, an environment with Git and have some kind of Python package management software. I recommend `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html>`_. Optionally, you can install `act <https://nektosact.com/installation/index.html>`_ to test out your workflows locally.
